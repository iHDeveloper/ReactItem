# React Item
Spigot plugin that customizes the items in Minecraft. By injecting states into the items. And, using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) philosophy.

Items should be registered to be identified from the vanilla items.
Each item has its own actions and if the state has changed while firing those actions. The item will be re-rendered (Aka changed).

This will allow the plugin developer to add more customized items.
And, even prevent the vanilla items to avoid unexpected behaviours.
